// Task 5: Explore about Segue and create a short note on its use.

//Segues are used to connect view controllers in the Storyboard. Segues can be viewed as lines connecting two view controllers.

//Segues allow us to present view controllers from one view controller, optionally using adaptive presentation

//The starting point of a segue is the button, table row, or gesture recognizer that initiates the segue. The end point of a segue is the view controller we want to display. A segue always presents a new view controller, but we can also use an unwind segue to dismiss a view controller

 Task 6: Explore diff between Xib's And ViewController and create a short note on its difference.
 
 Xib: XML interface builder.
 
 Earlier it was used to design iOS interface
 
  With xib, any custom view can be designed, which a developer can attach to a view controller as needed.
 Storyboards are introduced in iOS 5.
 When we use storyboards, our deployment target should be 5.0 or higher.
 With the help of storyboards we can create all the screens of an application and interconnect the screen under one interface MainStoryboard.storyboard. With storyboards we can use segues for pushing/presenting view controllers, therefore minimizing the lines of  code needed for pushing/presenting.
 ViewControllers are the part of StoryBoards and we use them as a layout of the screen and they are the base part of screen.
